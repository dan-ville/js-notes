# Philosophy of Programming
Think about this.

A computer is stupid. It's really good at a couple of things, but it can't think for itself. It has to be taught how to do literally everything. Well, technology has advanced a lot these days, even to the point where machines can "learn".

If you wanted to count to 10 with your fingers, you have ten fingers to do that with. What if you needed to count to ten with only one hand--how would you do it? If you need a hint, learn sign language. Now, what if you could only count to 10 using two fingers? That's more complex. You are limiting you computing capability to a binary system, where the two (bi) elements are your fingers.

A computer essentially runs on binary--a system where information is processed strictly with only two elements: a *zero* and a *one*. Everything we do on a computer, from typing with a keyboard, clicking with the mouse, interacting with the graphical user interface, showing color, watching movies... All of it has to boil down somehow to a 0 and 1.

We want to make computers do stuff for us to make our lives easier. Yet we have to make computers do stuff using a binary system. Computer Science is the story of how we use computers to do what we want. Programming is basically... writing the instructions.
